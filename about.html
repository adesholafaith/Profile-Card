          I'm Adeshola Faith and I am currently serving in the NYSC program. I
          build projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy bringing
          concepts to life through beautiful, user-friendly interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe great design is about clarity and experience, not just
          colors and shapes. Right now, I'm learning Git and GitHub, exploring
          new frontend frameworks, and continuously sharpening my JavaScript
          skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Ilorin where I studied
          microbiology. Before I graduated, my love for design and creativity
          pushed me to transition into tech. Since then, I have been
          continuously learning and practicing web development. I completed a
          frontend development course and then applied for internship at HNG,
          which I was accepted into.

        <p>By the end of the program, I hope to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Become comfortable with modern CSS and JavaScript frameworks.</li>
          <li>Practice responsive layouts and improved UX patterns.</li>
          <li>Gain opportunities that help me further improve my skills.</li>
        </ul>

      <section

        <h2 id="confidence-heading">Areas of low confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I'm still building confidence in advanced JavaScript concepts such as
          asynchronous programming, APIs, and state management. I also find
          frontend frameworks like React and Angular a bit challenging at the
          moment, especially when it comes to understanding their component
          structures and data flow. In addition, I'm working on improving my
          version control skills with Git and GitHub, as well as learning how to
          collaborate more effectively on larger projects.
        </p>

      <section

        aria-labelledby="extra-heading"
      >
        <h2 id="extra-heading">Extra thoughts</h2>
        This journey has taught me that learning frontend development is as much
        about patience and practice as it is about creativity. There are days
        when things don't work, and that's okay. Every bug fixed or layout
        improved is a step forward. <br />
        I've realized that consistency matters more than speed. Even small
        efforts each day build into something meaningful over time. I want to
        keep exploring new tools, stay curious about design and user experience,
        and never lose the excitement that got me started in the first place.
        <br />
        Most importantly, I want to remember that progress isn't always visible
        immediately, but it's happening quietly with every project, every
        challenge, and every lesson learned.
